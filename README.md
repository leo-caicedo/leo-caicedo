# Hi, I´m Leo 😎
I like learning about backend technologies.
Some programming languages that I use as tools are **Python** and **Nodejs**. 👨‍💻

I am also interested in topics such as Linux (currently I use Manjaro) since I find this tool very comfortable and I like its history.🚀
I strongly consider learning mobile development, apparently phones have conquered the world 😆
